Deleting Unnecessary Files: * Identify large files: * Start by identifying the largest files and folders in your Dropbox. These are the ones that will free up the most space. * Delete files: * Delete any files or folders that you no longer need. You can do this through the Dropbox website or the Dropbox folder on your computer. * Empty the deleted files,5

You need to switch accounts every time you want to upload. In the past to could just choose a file to upload and then decide which account and folder to put it in. No more.,5

There needs to be a configurable timeout, eg. don't prompt for passcode until X minutes after switching app if the phone is not locked. Furthermore, it prompts for fingerprint TWICE on each and every download, this is too excessive! Devs please fix",3

For example I can no longer open files unless I rename them to .txt And there were no annoying popups when I was offline. I wish i could get the simple old Dropbox apps back which I loved using so much.",2

I bought a new phone in 2016. Then I had no use for Dropbox. And now in 2023 there is not even a trace of the files I backed up over the years. Please don't trust Dropbox to have your files for you. With a few years you'll become a new user to Dropbox it doesn't even know that I was it's coustomer for years. And my memories are gone.,1

It's just an app for accessing files from the dropbox servers while connected to the internet, but fails to keep offline files or directory trees, and doesn't cache files locally where you could browse/edit them with the app you actually want to use. The interface is also utterly dumb, eg re-opening itself all the way back at its root when you just want to move a file into an adjacent subdirectory. At least you can access your txt files while online.",2

efc938c2-5816-407b-87f0-675c43e7a677,Initial review: solid mobile client for my purposes. Works well with backing up selected folders on my mobile devices (though it was unclear at first since i had to save new files in order for dropbox to discover other folders and display the option to select which folders to back up) and accessing cloud stored files to upload in other apps. Would be a big improvement to support search when uploading a file to another app and browsing dropbox for files to upload (only works directly in-app),4
08d41610-5cff-451b-81ea-628bb051143a,All I want to do is get into my Dropbox and delete a lot of pictures but no matter what I do it won't let me. It's trying to force me to upgrade but I don't want too. The Dropbox should allow you to pick what you want to save. Not save every pic you take.,1
